Etch-a-Sketch - part of The Odin Project.

On PC / laptop: moving the mouse over the "draw area" changes the color of the elements.

On phones (and generally touchscreens) drawing is done by clicking the elements in the draw area.

Two color-schemes available: grayscale and rainbow.

Custom size of the grid.
